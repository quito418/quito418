**I am an AI & Data team lead at Institute of Genome Insight (Inocras), where I collaborate with geneticists to develop secondary and tertiary analysis solutions for genomics data, aiming to uncover novel biological insights to enhance human health.** 

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, where I was advised by [Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/) and [Young Seok Ju](https://www.julab.kaist.ac.kr/members). My [dissertation](https://quito418.github.io/quito418/assets/pdf/youngmok_dissertation.pdf) introduced new methods for improving genome analysis with AI and ML. Before then, I received my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, South Korea.

My interests are in crafting high-performance systems that incorporate AI/ML approaches. I concentrate on utilizing underlying assumptions of real-world systems to enhance the integration of AI/ML techniques. 
My work aims at:
1. Designing efficient systems built on AI/ML approaches.
2. Improving AI/ML approaches by exploiting system-specific assumptions.

All my work involves several months of implementation followed by thorough testing in real-world data.

Recently, I am striving to develop secondary and tertiary analysis solutions for genomics data using AI/ML approaches. Concurrently, I have worked on various topics in high-performance networked systems, including AI-enhanced video delivery systems and data-center networking.
